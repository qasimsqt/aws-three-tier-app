## AWS Three-Tier Web Architecture Deployment
A fully deployed, secure, and scalable three-tier application on AWS, built from scratch.

# Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a three-tier architecture consisting of:

Web Tier â€“ Internet-facing EC2 instances behind a public Application Load Balancer.

App Tier â€“ Private EC2 instances behind an internal Load Balancer.

Database Tier â€“ Amazon RDS MySQL instance in private subnets.

# Services Used
Amazon EC2 â€“ Web and App tiers

Elastic Load Balancing â€“ Public & internal load balancers

Amazon RDS (MySQL) â€“ Managed relational database

Amazon VPC â€“ Custom networking, 5 subnets (public & private)

Security Groups & NACLs â€“ Network security

IAM â€“ Role-based access control

Cloudcraft â€“ Architecture diagram

# Deployment Steps
Networking

Created a VPC with 5 subnets (public & private).

Attached an Internet Gateway and configured route tables.

Web Tier

Launched EC2 instances in public subnets.

Configured an Internet-facing ALB.

App Tier

Launched EC2 instances in private subnets.

Connected via an internal ALB from the web tier.

Database Tier

Created an RDS MySQL instance in private subnets.

Restricted access to App tier only.

Security

Configured SGs to allow only necessary traffic (HTTP/HTTPS/MySQL).

Used IAM roles for EC2 and Cloudcraft integration.

# Lessons Learned
Difference between internal and internet-facing load balancers.

How private subnets secure backend services.

Troubleshooting security group & networking issues.
